Hello everyone!

With experience as an optometrist, including working with patients in diverse settings,
I’m excited to embark on a journey into the world of cloud computing with AWS (Amazon Web Services). While my career has primarily focused on eye care, I’ve discovered that many of the skills I’ve developed in this field are highly transferable to technology.

One moment that crystallised my interest in technology occurred during a project to integrate new diagnostic equipment into our practice. I was fascinated by the technology behind the device and how it improved our workflow and patient outcomes. This experience sparked my curiosity about the broader field of technology and its potential to drive innovation. As I delved deeper into cloud computing, I realised how my analytical skills and problem-solving mindset could be applied to designing and optimising cloud architectures.

Working in optometry required a deep level of analytical thinking and problem-solving. Diagnosing eye conditions and developing effective treatment plans demanded meticulous attention to detail—skills that are just as crucial in cloud computing. In tech, the ability to analyse complex systems and troubleshoot issues is essential for designing scalable and efficient cloud solutions.

Communication was another key aspect of my role. Clearly explaining diagnoses and treatment options to patients is similar to articulating technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. The ability to convey complex information in an understandable way is vital for successful collaboration and project management in the tech world.

Time management and organisation were also crucial in balancing patient care with administrative responsibilities. These skills are important in managing multiple aspects of cloud projects, ensuring timely delivery and efficient use of resources.

In addition to these technical skills, the soft skills I developed—such as empathy, patience, and a proactive approach to problem-solving—are invaluable in any professional setting. They help in understanding user needs, addressing challenges creatively, and working effectively with diverse teams.

## What’s Next:

As I build on my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and work towards the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate certification, I’m focusing on several foundational areas within AWS:

- **Serverless Computing**: Exploring AWS Lambda and related services.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implementing pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
- **Data Storage and Management**: Working with Amazon S3, DynamoDB, and other data services.
- **Cloud Security**: Learning best practices and tools to secure cloud environments.
- **Architectural Design and Scalability**: Designing resilient and scalable solutions.

These foundational projects are crucial for understanding AWS’s capabilities and preparing for more complex challenges ahead. I’m excited about the prospect of diving into more advanced topics and innovative solutions in the future.

## Achievements:

I’m proud to have earned the **IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate** and the **IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate**. These certifications have equipped me with a solid foundation in various application development and cloud technologies, and I’m eager to apply these skills in my cloud computing journey.

## Stay Connected:

I’ll be sharing updates and insights on my blog as I progress with these projects. For more detailed information and to follow along with my work, please visit my GitHub page. I’ll be posting my projects, insights, and learnings there, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions.

Additionally, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for professional updates and networking opportunities.
